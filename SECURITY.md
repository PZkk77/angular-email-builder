## Security Best Practices

When using `@beefree.io/angular-email-builder`:

### 1. Never Expose API Credentials

**NEVER** include Beefree API credentials in frontend code. Always fetch tokens from your backend:

```typescript
// SECURE - Backend handles credentials
const token = await fetch('/api/beefree/token', {
  credentials: 'include'
}).then(res => res.json())
```

### 2. Validate User Input

Always validate and sanitize any user input before passing it to the builder.

### 3. Keep Dependencies Updated

Regularly update `@beefree.io/angular-email-builder` and its dependencies.

### 4. Use HTTPS

Always serve your application over HTTPS in production.

### 5. Implement Authentication

Ensure proper authentication is in place before allowing users to access the builder.
